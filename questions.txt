1. What is the result of query: ?- father(X, 'Queen Elizabeth II').?
	X = 'King George VI'.

2. What is the result of query: ?- grandmother(X, 'Queen Elizabeth II').?
	X = 'Queen Mary'. 

3. What is the result of query: ?- grandfather(X, 'Queen Elizabeth II').?
	X = 'King George V'.

4. What is the result of query: ?- grandparent(X, 'Queen Elizabeth II').?
	X = 'King George V' ;
	X = 'Queen Mary'.

5. What is the result of query: ?- grandparent('Queen Elizabeth II', X).?
	X = 'Prince William' ;
	X = 'Prince Henry'. 

6. What is the result of query: ?- sibling(X, 'Queen Elizabeth II').?
	X = 'Princess Margaret' 

7. What is the result of query: ?- son(X, 'Queen Elizabeth II').?
	X = 'Prince Charles' ;
	X = 'Prince Andrew' ;
	X = 'Prince Edward'.

8. What is the result of query: ?- daughter(X, 'Queen Elizabeth II').?
	X = 'Princess Anne'.

9. What is the result of query: ?- aunt(X, 'Lady Diana Spencer').?
	This query is false because Lady Diana was not born into the royal family, so there isn't any information on her family in the database.

10. What is the result of query: ?- spouse(X, 'Prince William').?
	X = 'Catherine Middleton'.

11. What is the result of query: ?- ancestor(X, 'Prince Henry').?
	X = 'Prince Charles' ;
	X = 'Lady Diana Spencer' ;
	X = 'Queen Elizabeth II' ;
	X = 'Prince Philip' ;
	X = 'King George VI' ;
	X = 'Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon' ;
	X = 'King George V' ;
	X = 'Queen Mary' ;
	X = 'King Edward VII' ;
	X = 'Princess Alexandra of Denmark' ;
	X = 'Prince Albert' ;
	X = 'Queen Victoria'.

12. What is the result of query: ?- descendant('Queen Victoria', Y).?
	This query is false because Queen Victoria is the first royal listed in the database and there isn't any information about her ancestors in it.

13. What is the result of query: ?- older('Prince Henry', 'Prince William').?
	This query is false because Prince Henry is not older than Prince William.  Prince William is the older brother.

14. What is the result of query: ?- older(X, 'Queen Elizabeth II').?
	X = 'Queen Victoria' ;
	X = 'Princess Alexandra of Denmark' ;
	X = 'Queen Mary' ;
	X = 'Mrs Simpson' ;
	X = 'Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon' ;
	X = 'Prince Albert' ;
	X = 'King Edward VII' ;
	X = 'King George V' ;
	X = 'King Edward VIII' ;
	X = 'King George VI' ;
	X = 'Prince Philip'

15. What is the result of query: ?- regentWhenBorn(X, 'Queen Elizabeth II').?

EC1. X = 'Viscount Linley' ;

EC2. X = 'Viscount Linley' ;
	 X = 'Lady Sarah Chatto'. 

16. Name something you like about Prolog. Explain.
	I really like how straightforward prolog is.  Once you understand how prolog unifies variables, writing rules becomes very easy and logical.

17. Name something you dislike about Prolog. Explain.
	Learning the completely different syntax of Prolog operators was challenging.  I also thought that the sytax error when an incorrect operator was used wasn't as useful as I wanted it to be.  It took me a while to realize that syntax error was telling me that I'd miss-typed something most of the time.  

18. Did you enjoy this lab? Which aspects did you like and/or dislike?
	I did enjoy this lab.  I liked the logical ways in which the rules were structured and how you could build on the previous rules with each new one.  Running a query and getting a correct answer was very satisfying.  I wished that there was more information in the database, but overall I really enjoyed the lab.

19. Approximately how many hours did you spend on this lab?
	I spent 4-5 hours on this lab.  Some of it was just learning to use Prolog properly and some of it was not understanding some of the errors that I was getting.  

20. Do you think you will use Prolog again? For which type(s) of project(s)?
	I'm not sure if I will use Prolog again.  I would welcome the chance if I had it, but I don't think it is very widely used for industry purposes.
